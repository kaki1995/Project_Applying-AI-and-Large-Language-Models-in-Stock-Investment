# Project_Applying-AI-and-Large-Language-Models-in-Stock-Investment

This project applies AI and Machine Learning to develop a data-driven investment strategy for stock selection and portfolio optimization.
Using Random Forest Classification and Regression models, we identified the top 30 out of 200 S&P 500 stocks with the highest potential returns, optimized portfolio weights via Sharpe ratio maximization, and simulated weekly rebalancing over a 9-week trading period.

Key Features:

📊 10-year dataset of 200 S&P 500 stocks (Refinitiv & Yahoo Finance)

⚙️ Random Forest–based stock ranking and return prediction

💡 Portfolio optimization under risk constraints (max/min allocation limits)

📈 Trading simulation and performance benchmarking vs. S&P 500

🔍 Evaluation using Sharpe Ratio, Beta, Alpha, and OLS regression

Tech stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
